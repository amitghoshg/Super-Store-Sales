This repository contains an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the Super Store Sales dataset. The analysis aims to uncover key insights and trends in sales performance across different regions, categories, and customer segments.

# Overview
The Super Store Sales dataset includes transactional data from a retail store, covering various aspects such as sales, top customer, top sales generating regions and shipping information. This EDA project focuses on:

1> Data Cleaning:-                Handling missing values and ensuring data consistency.
2> Descriptive Statistics:-       Summarizing key metrics like sales upon years,top sales generating region and discount top customer etc.
3> Visualization:-                Using charts and graphs to illustrate sales performance by category, region and state.
4> Problem Analysis:-             In this store, a significant problem has been detected with the shipping methods; most of them are not efficient, resulting in considerable delays.


# Tools and Libraries

###Python:-                  Primary programming language used for the analysis.
##Pandas:-                  For data manipulation and analysis.
Matplotlib & Seaborn:-    For data visualization.
Plotly:-                  For interactive visualization.
Jupyter Notebook:-        To document the analysis process.

# Results
The EDA reveals important insights, such as the most profitable regions and product categories, most selling products and customer purchasing behavior. These findings can help drive better business decisions and strategies.
