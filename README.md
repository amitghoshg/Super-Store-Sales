The Super Store Sales dataset includes transactional data from a retail store, covering various aspects such as sales, top customer, top sales generating regions and shipping information. This EDA project focuses on:

### 1> Data Cleaning:-                Handling missing values and ensuring data consistency.
### 2> Descriptive Statistics:-       Summarizing key metrics like sales upon years,top sales generating region and discount top customer etc.
### 3> Visualization:-                Using charts and graphs to illustrate sales performance by category, region and state.
### 4> Problem Analysis:-             In this store, a significant problem has been detected with the shipping methods; most of them are not efficient, resulting in considerable delays.
